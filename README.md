# Crayon
based on much better projects like openTK and GLFW.net.
This is really just my own experiment in rendering. 

If you have ideas on how to make this actually good i'm open to suggestions.

## Summary
### EngineGL
Wraps all of the external libraries (GLFW, GLAD, STBI) for use on the c# side using CLR
### GL
Handles all the externals related to GLAD (mainly rendering).
### GLFW
Handles all the externals related to GLFW (Windowing and input).
### STBI
Handles all the externals related to STB_Image (Image loading for textures).
### Graphics
Rendering stuff (buffers, shaders, ect.).
### Input
mouse and keyboad input handling.
### Utilities
stuff for managing project assets.
### Windowing
stuff for creating a template windowed application.
### Mathematics
my math library, mainly just a wrapper for System.numerics, to match the style of someting like glmSharp.
## Plans
I've been busy, so at this point, This project might even be useable if it had any documentation.
Im not gonna create an actual roadmap, but you can probably expect documentation eventually.
That or I'll write an image Loader.
## Benchmark Gallery
coming soon
